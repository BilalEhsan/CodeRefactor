Positives

Repository Pattern:
    The code uses Repository Pattern that provides separation of concerns which helps to separate the logic 
    that retrieves data from the underlying data source from the business logic of the application.
    This can create more maintainable, testable, and flexible application that is easier to maintain and extend over time.

Dependency Injection:
    The classes uses dependency injection to inject the BookingRepository, Mailer and Logger,
    enhancing testability and reducing tight coupling.

Use of Config: 
    The use of configuration values from env() and config() functions is a good practice as it allows
    for easy configuration changes without modifying the code.

Proper Commenting: 
    Comments are provided at the beginning of each method, which helps in understanding the purpose of the methods.

Consistent Naming: 
    The naming conventions used for classes and functions are consistent, making the code more understandable.

Use of Laravel Framework:
    The code follows the Laravel framework's conventions, including the use of request objects, model relationships,
    and controller methods.


Negatives

Complexity and Size:
    The 'booking repository' class seems quite long and complex, which may make it harder to maintain and test. 
    Consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused classes or methods. This would follow the
    Single Responsibility Principle from SOLID.

Naming Convention:
    Variable names don't follow standard naming convention (camelCase).

Magic Values:
    There are some "true" and "false" values hardcoded as strings. It's better to use boolean values (true and false) directly.
    There are some other magic values used like 15', 'rws' and 'unpaid' etc. The best practice is to avoid 
    magic values and instead use named variables with descriptive names that reflect their purpose and meaning.

Hard-Coded Values:
     There are hard-coded values, such as 'admin_logger', 'completed', and 'pending' etc, which should be defined as constants 
     or configuration values to improve maintainability.

Separation of Concerns:
    Some methods seems to be doing too many things, including handling database updates, conditional checks,
    sending emails, sending notifications and dispatching events. Consider breaking it down into smaller,
    more focused methods.

Code Reuse:
    There is some repetition in the code for returning responses, which could be reduced by creating a helper
    function or middleware to handle common response logic.

Error Handling: 
    The code lacks detailed error handling.  It doesn't check for exceptions or handle unexpected situations and in
    some places error suppression is used. In a production environment, it's important to handle exceptions and errors
    more gracefully and provide informative error responses.

Validation:
   Code lacks detailed validation rules, including checking for required fields and data types.

Comments: 
    While method names are mostly self-explanatory, additional inline comments within complex methods
    could improve code understandability.




Formatting:
    1) The code follows PSR-2 standards, with consistent indentation and spacing, making it easy to read and understand.
    2) The naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes are clear and consistent, enhancing code readability.
    3) The code follows proper indentation, making it easy to distinguish different blocks and scopes.
    4) Some lines of code are quite lengthy, which can reduce readability. It's recommended to limit line lengths to improve
        code readability and maintainability.
    5) The code generally uses proper whitespace, making it more readable and visually appealing.

Logic:
    1) The logic in the methods appears to be straightforward and easy to follow.
    2) The code has several conditional statements that determine the flow of the program. Some complex 
        conditional blocks could be simplified or refactored for better readability.
 



Overall Assessment:
    The code shows good use of Laravel conventions and generally follows standard coding practices.
    The BookingRepository class should be broken down into multiple smaller classes. The notification and email sending 
    logic could be abstracted into a dedicated service for better management and reusability. Refactoring some of
    the complex logic and incorporating more comprehensive error handling would make the code more robust and maintainable.
